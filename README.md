</p>

A Claude Code plugin that shows a **plain-English rewrite** of each assistant
message, produced by a **local LLM via ollama**. It is **display-only**: Claude's
own reasoning and the saved transcript keep the original text — only what you
read on screen changes.

An optional second hook rewrites **Markdown files** into plain English when they
are written or edited (opt-in, off by default).

> Status: working prototype. Every hook fails **open** — if anything goes wrong
> (ollama down, timeout, missing dependency), you simply see Claude's original
> text. The plugin can never swallow or corrupt an answer.

## What this fork changes

The fork changes one thing: what the **display hook** tells the local model.

| | Upstream | My fork | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Conversation** | Sends your last question. | Sends your newest question, the replies to it so far, and the [5 exchanges before that](#how-the-display-hook-works). Counts every message it leaves out. | One question is thin. The model rewrites an answer without knowing what came before it. |
| **Project words** | Sends none. | Sends [`CONTEXT.md`](#project-vocabulary) (or `docs/CONTEXT.md`), capped, and says to keep those exact words. | Without it the rewrite changes your words. `display hook` came back as "display script"; `fails open` became "if the rewrite fails". |
| **Style** | Asks for short sentences and everyday words. | Also asks for Simplified Technical English. | House style. The line goes last, next to the message it points at. |

New settings: `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT`, `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURNS`,
`CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURN_MSGS`, `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_CHARS`,
`CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_DOC_CHARS`. See [Configuration](#configuration-env-vars).

Everything else is upstream's and unchanged: the fail-open contract, both display
modes, the Markdown hook, and every other setting.

## Requirements (read this first)

This plugin shells out to a **local** model. Nothing works until these are in place:

| Requirement | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **ollama**, running | Does the rewriting, locally | `brew install ollama` then `ollama serve` |
| A pulled model | The actual rewriter | `ollama pull gemma4:26b-mlx` (~17 GB; choose the model that fits into your memory) |
| `jq` | Parses hook JSON | ships with macOS; else `brew install jq` |
| `curl` | Talks to ollama | ships with macOS |

Warm the model once after `ollama serve` (the first call is a slow cold load):

```bash
ollama run gemma4:26b-mlx "hi"
```

**If the local model isn't ready, the plugin does nothing to your text** —
Claude's output shows normally, unchanged. That is by design, not a bug. It skips
(fails open) when ollama is down, the request times out, or the model isn't
pulled. The first time that happens in a session it tells you why: the display
hook appends a one-line notice on screen, and the Markdown hook shows a
`systemMessage`. So a silent skip is never a mystery (once per session; set
`CLAUDISH_NOTICE=0` to silence it).

**Pick a model you actually have.** The default is `gemma4:26b-mlx`. Pull it (as
above), or pull a smaller/faster model and point the plugin at it by setting
`CLAUDISH_MODEL` to that model's exact ollama tag in your `env` (see
[Configuring the plugin](#configuring-the-plugin)). If `CLAUDISH_MODEL` names a
model you have not pulled, every rewrite is skipped — with the one-time notice
above.

---

## Install

Directly from this repository (also serves its own marketplace):

```shell
/plugin marketplace add will-ness-ai/claudish-to-english
/plugin install claudish-to-english@gvzdv-plugins
```

The marketplace still carries the upstream name `gvzdv-plugins`, which is why
the second line reads that way. The source is this fork.

To install the upstream plugin instead — without this fork's conversation
context and project vocabulary — use `gvzdv/claudish-to-english`.

If the install summary says `Run /reload-plugins to activate.`, run that command.

**Try before installing** (loads it for one session, no install):

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claudish-to-english
```

Run `/reload-plugins` after edits; if it doesn't load, check the `/plugin`
**Errors** tab.

---

## Configuring the plugin

All behavior is controlled by `CLAUDISH_*` environment variables (full list in
[Configuration](#configuration-env-vars) below). When you install from a
marketplace, set them in Claude Code's **`env` block in `settings.json`** — do
**not** edit the plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json`, which lives in the read-only
plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/…`) and is overwritten on every update.

For a personal, all-projects setup, use `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDISH_MODEL": "gemma4:26b-mlx",
    "CLAUDISH_MODE": "append"
  }
}
```

The hooks are subprocesses Claude Code spawns, so they inherit these. A few
things to know:

- **Restart Claude Code after editing `env`.** The value is captured at launch,
  so a running session keeps the old one.
- **`env` does not merge across scopes.** The highest-precedence settings file
  that defines `env` supplies the *entire* block — it isn't combined with lower
  scopes. Precedence: managed → local → project → user. Keep all your
  `CLAUDISH_*` vars in whichever file wins.
- **Scopes:** `~/.claude/settings.json` (all your projects) ·
  `.claude/settings.json` (shared with a repo, checked in) ·
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (just you, just this repo).

Quick one-off without editing a file — hooks inherit the launching shell:

```bash
CLAUDISH_MODEL=llama3.2:3b claude
```

To confirm the hook is firing, set `CLAUDISH_DEBUG=1` and watch
`"$TMPDIR"/claudish-to-english/debug.log`.

---

## How the display hook works

Claude Code fires the `MessageDisplay` event **once per streamed chunk**, not
once per message. Each fire is a separate process carrying `message_id`,
`index`, a `final` flag, and this chunk's `delta` (a text fragment, not the
whole message). So the hook **buffers every delta** to a temp file (keyed by
`message_id`) and only calls the model on the **final** chunk, once the whole
message is known:

```
chunk 0 (final:false) ─┐
chunk 1 (final:false) ─┤ append each delta to $TMPDIR/claudish-to-english/<session>/<message>/<index>.part
chunk 2 (final:false) ─┘  → emit nothing (append) or "" (replace)
chunk 3 (final:true)  ──► reconstruct full message → call ollama once → show the rewrite
                          → delete the buffer
```

On that final chunk it also reads the **recent conversation** from the transcript
and passes it to the model as **context only** — to keep the rewrite on-topic.
The model is told never to answer or repeat that context; it only rewrites the
assistant's message.

The excerpt is built from **exchanges**, not from a flat count of messages. An
exchange starts at a user message and runs to the next one. It holds:

- the **current exchange** — the user's newest question, plus the last
  `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURN_MSGS` replies to it so far (default 3);
- the `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURNS` exchanges before it (default 5), each compressed
  to its user message and its final reply.

Every message is cut to `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_CHARS` characters (default 800), and
every message left out is counted — in the header, and inline where the cut
happened. The model is told the excerpt is partial instead of being left to
assume it is the whole conversation:

```
Recent conversation, oldest first. It shows 8 of the 21 messages in this session; 13 message(s) are not shown.

[user] Set up https://github.com/gvzdv/claudish-to-english

[… 1 more reply in this exchange, not shown]

[assistant] Plugin is installed. One blocker remains …

[user] A, then: 1. fork the repo …

[… 12 more replies in this exchange, not shown]

[assistant] All three parts are done …
```

Anchoring on the user's question is deliberate. A flat "last N messages" window
breaks on an agentic turn: a long run of tool calls fills it with assistant
status lines and pushes the question out entirely. Compressing older exchanges
is deliberate too — the replies between a question and its final answer are
tool-step preambles, which add length without grounding.

Only prose reaches the model. Thinking blocks, tool calls, tool results,
subagent (sidechain) lines, and meta lines are all dropped, and the message
being rewritten is excluded. One assistant reply can span several transcript
lines that share a message id; those are merged back into one message, so a
counted "message" is a real turn, not a log line.

### Project vocabulary

If `CONTEXT.md` or `docs/CONTEXT.md` sits in the hook's working directory, its
first `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_DOC_CHARS` characters (default 4000) go into the prompt
as the project's **ubiquitous language**, and the model is told to keep those
exact terms.

Without it a rewrite quietly flattens the words a project runs on. Measured on
this repo's own glossary, same message, same model:

| | Rewrite |
|---|---|
| No `CONTEXT.md` | "…**updated the display hook**. If the rewrite fails, you will see the original text" — `fail open` is gone |
| With `CONTEXT.md` | "…changed the **display hook**. If there is a problem, the **rewrite** will **fail open**" |

The cap exists because the model reads every character of that file before it
writes a word. On an M4 Pro against `gemma4:26b-mlx`: 4000 characters cost 5s,
12000 cost 8s, and a whole 29KB glossary cost 13s. All fit inside the 45s
`CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT`, so raise the cap if your glossary is long and the wait is
acceptable.

The prompt then closes with a re-pitch instruction — *"The user doesn't
understand. Re-pitch that: give me a little bit of context, talk in Simplified
Technical English"* — and names `CONTEXT.md` in that sentence **only** when the
file was actually found. It goes last so that it sits beside the message it
points at. Placement was tested both ways — last, and above the context blocks —
and `gemma4:26b-mlx` rewrote the correct message in 20 of 20 runs either way, so
treat this as a choice of layout, not a fix for a known failure.

Set `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT=0` to send no context at all — no excerpt, no `CONTEXT.md`.

### Display modes

| `CLAUDISH_MODE` | On screen | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `append` (default) | Original streams normally, then a `💬 In plain English:` block is appended. | Safest. No streaming loss; if the LLM fails you just don't get the extra block. |
| `replace` | Only the simplified version (original chunks suppressed while streaming). | Experimental. Appears all at once after LLM latency; on failure it re-shows the full original. |

---

## Markdown file rewrite (optional second hook)

A `PostToolUse` hook (`rewrite-md.sh`) rewrites Markdown **files** into plain
English when they are written or edited. Unlike the display hook, this changes
bytes on disk.

**Opt-in by directory.** It does nothing unless `CLAUDISH_MD_DIR` is set, and it
only touches `*.md` files whose resolved path is inside that directory. Every
other `README`, `CLAUDE.md`, or doc you edit is left alone.

| `CLAUDISH_MD_MODE` | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sibling` (default) | Writes `NAME.plain.md` next to `NAME.md`. | Non-destructive; the original is never touched. |
| `overwrite` | Replaces `NAME.md` in place. | Adds a `<!-- claudish-to-english:rewritten -->` marker so a re-write is skipped (idempotent). A weak model can degrade real docs — use with care. |

In both modes: YAML frontmatter is split off and re-attached **verbatim**, fenced
code is left to the model instruction, short files are skipped, and the write is
atomic. Fail-open here means the file is left **exactly as the agent wrote it**.

**Large files are slow.** `gemma4:26b-mlx` (the default) rewrites at roughly 60
tokens/s, so a long plan or spec can take 30–120s. This hook allows up to
`CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` (150s) inside a 180s `PostToolUse` hook budget; if a rewrite
still times out you get the one-time notice above — raise those limits, or set
`CLAUDISH_MODEL` to a smaller model.

Enable it for one directory, in sibling mode (the safe default), the same way
as every other setting — the `env` block of your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDISH_MD_DIR": "/ABS/PATH/docs/plain",
    "CLAUDISH_MD_MODE": "sibling"
  }
}
```

In `overwrite` mode the marker comment is written **after** any YAML
frontmatter, so the frontmatter stays on line 1 where parsers expect it.

## Configuration (env vars)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDISH_ENABLED` | `1` | Master switch. `0` = pass everything through. Read once at session start. |
| `CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE` | `~/.claude/claudish-off` | Runtime kill switch. While this file exists, rewrites pause — re-checked every message, so unlike env vars it works mid-session. See [Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODE` | `append` | `append` or `replace` (display hook). |
| `CLAUDISH_MODEL` | `gemma4:26b-mlx` | ollama model name. |
| `CLAUDISH_OLLAMA` | `http://localhost:11434` | ollama base URL. |
| `CLAUDISH_MIN_CHARS` | `200` | Skip messages/files whose prose (code stripped) is shorter than this. |
| `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT` | `1` | `1` = send recent conversation as context (display hook). `0` = send the message alone. |
| `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURNS` | `5` | Exchanges before the current one, each compressed to its user message and final reply. |
| `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_TURN_MSGS` | `3` | Replies kept from the **current** exchange, newest first. The user's question itself is always kept. |
| `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_CHARS` | `800` | Per-message truncation inside that context. |
| `CLAUDISH_CONTEXT_DOC_CHARS` | `4000` | Cap on the `CONTEXT.md` / `docs/CONTEXT.md` excerpt sent as project vocabulary. Costs latency — see [Project vocabulary](#project-vocabulary). |
| `CLAUDISH_STUB` | `0` | `1` = deterministic stub instead of the model (for testing display mechanics). |
| `CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT` | `45` | LLM client timeout for the **display** hook (seconds). Keep it below that hook's `timeout` (60s). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` | `150` | LLM client timeout for the **Markdown file** hook (seconds). Higher on purpose — a large model rewriting a long doc is slow. Keep it below the `PostToolUse` hook `timeout` (180s). |
| `CLAUDISH_DEBUG` | `0` | `1` = write a debug log to `$TMPDIR/claudish-to-english/`. |
| `CLAUDISH_NOTICE` | `1` | `1` = show a one-time, once-per-session notice when a rewrite is skipped because ollama is unreachable, the call timed out, or the model isn't pulled (display hook appends it on screen; Markdown hook uses a `systemMessage`). `0` = stay fully silent (pure fail-open). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_DIR` | *(unset)* | **Markdown hook opt-in.** Only `*.md` under this directory is rewritten. Unset = the Markdown hook does nothing. |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_MODE` | `sibling` | `sibling` (`NAME.plain.md`) or `overwrite` (in place). |
| `CLAUDISH_MD_SUFFIX` | `plain` | Sibling infix: `NAME.<suffix>.md`. |

In `hooks/hooks.json` the display hook (`MessageDisplay`) has a 60s `timeout` and
the Markdown hook (`PostToolUse`) has a 180s `timeout` — the file hook is higher
because a large model rewriting a long document can take a couple of minutes.
`CLAUDISH_TIMEOUT` and `CLAUDISH_MD_TIMEOUT` keep the LLM call itself bounded
below those ceilings, so it fails open cleanly instead of being killed mid-write.

**Quick kill switch:** set `CLAUDISH_ENABLED=0` or disable the plugin (both apply
only from the next session start), or `touch ~/.claude/claudish-off` to pause a
session that's already running — see [Toggling mid-session](#toggling-mid-session)
below.

### Toggling mid-session

`CLAUDISH_ENABLED` and the other env vars are read once, when a session launches,
so they can't pause rewrites in a session that's already running. For that, both
hooks also check a **flag file** on every invocation — each fire is a fresh
process, so the check is always live:

```bash
touch ~/.claude/claudish-off   # pause rewrites, effective on the next message
rm    ~/.claude/claudish-off   # resume
```

You create and remove this file yourself; nothing creates it on install, and its
absence is the normal "on" state. While it exists, `ENABLED` is forced to `0` and
the fail-open path leaves Claude's original text untouched. Point a hotkey at a
two-line toggle script to flip rewrites from the keyboard across all running
sessions at once. Override the path with `CLAUDISH_OFF_FILE`.

### Reasoning models

The request sends `"think": false`. Models with a hidden reasoning phase
otherwise spend most of their time generating reasoning tokens you never see —
much slower for identical output quality on this simple task. Keep it off.

---

## Privacy / egress

The rewriter runs **entirely locally** against ollama, so **no conversation
content leaves your machine**. Each display-hook call sends the assistant message,
the recent-conversation excerpt described above, and — when the project has one
— the capped `CONTEXT.md` excerpt; tool results and file contents are not part
of the conversation excerpt, but a message may of course quote them. If
you ever point `CLAUDISH_OLLAMA` at a remote/hosted endpoint, all of that would
be sent off-box — don't do that unless you understand and accept it. Set
`CLAUDISH_CONTEXT=0` to send the message alone.
